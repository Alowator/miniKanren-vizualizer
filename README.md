## qt/qml vizualizer placed in root folder and can be opened in Qt Creator using `Import Project -> Git Clone`

`miniKanren.js` contains current verison of `unicanren/main.ml` compiled into JavaScript

----
## unicanren placed in folder `unicanren`

Now unicanren collected in singe file - `unicanren/main.ml`

- Call of appendo happens in end of `unicanren/main.ml` file
- Tree builds in `let eval ?(trace_svars = false) ?(trace_uni = false) ?(trace_calls = false)`
function, using `Js.Unsafe.global##` calls

### How to convert main.ml into javascript:
* ocamlfind ocamlc -package base -package js_of_ocaml-ppx -linkpkg -o js_of_ocaml -o main.byte main.ml
* js_of_ocaml +base/runtime.js main.byte --pretty

Then content of `unicanren/main.js` must be placed in `miniKanren.js` after `// Generated by js_of_ocaml 4.0.0` line

## todo:
1. Tree doesn't output current variables, it's output only function names
2. There are counterexamples where the tree is built incorrectly
3. Tree looks very bad
4. Unicanren collected in singe file, it's worth convert into javascript dune project (problem with javascript compilation flags)
